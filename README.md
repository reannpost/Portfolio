# Portfolio
Hi! Welcome to my professional coding portfolio. I have included some snippets of code that I've written which I feel demonstrate the breadth of my coding knowledge and abilities.

Here's an [example of some code](assignment_3_sample.md) I wrote that sifts through a large dataframe and extracts relevant information regarding counts of the data.

Another thing I've learned over the past couple months is the importance of concise code. For loops are a way to perform a single action many times, while keeping the lines of code to a minimum. Here is an [example of a loop](for_loop_example.md) that I wrote in collaboration with my teammates for project 1.

The final thing I want to share here is some [datavisualization](datavis_example.md). Data visualization is a key part of EDA that can highlight patterns in the data which are often missed by statistical or numerical EDA.
